# Personal website

This is the source code to my personal website, <r3n.nl>.

## Setup

This is a pretty simple static minisite (meaning, the output is only css + html). Tools I used:

- Gulp (build pipeline)
- Pug (cleaner html)
- Sass (cleaner css)
- BrowserSync (live-reload while developing)
- Minifiers (html-minifier, cssnano)
- Prefixers (autoprefixer)
